# PyTorch for Python 3.13
# Latest development version for Python 3.13 support

# Note: Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) is NOT available for Python 3.13
# This means CPU inference will be slower compared to Python 3.11/3.12
# Consider using Python 3.11 or 3.12 for better CPU performance

# Alternative optimizations for Python 3.13
# Since IPEX is not available, we use other optimization libraries

# ONNX Runtime for CPU optimization (alternative to IPEX)
onnxruntime>=1.17.0

# Additional CPU optimizations
threadpoolctl>=3.0.0
numexpr>=2.8.0

# Memory profiling
memory-profiler>=0.61.0
py-spy>=0.3.14

# Python 3.13 specific - free-threading support utilities
# (These help manage the GIL-free environment)
concurrent-log-handler>=0.9.25
