# Intel Extension for PyTorch - CURRENTLY INCOMPATIBLE
# IPEX 2.5.0 requires PyTorch 2.8.x which is not yet stable
# Our model requires PyTorch 2.5.1 for compatibility
# IPEX will be available once PyTorch 2.8 becomes stable
#
# Alternative optimizations are automatically included:
# - Intel MKL (comes with PyTorch)
# - OpenMP for parallel processing
# - AutoRound quantization for memory efficiency

# Optional Intel optimizations (uncomment to install)
# Intel Neural Compressor for additional quantization optimizations
# neural-compressor>=2.5.0

# OpenVINO for alternative inference backend
# openvino>=2024.0.0
# optimum-intel>=1.15.0

# ONNX Runtime with Intel optimizations
# onnxruntime-openvino>=1.17.0

# Additional optimizations for Intel CPUs
mkl>=2023.0.0
mkl-service>=2.4.0

# Memory profiling (useful for optimization)
memory-profiler>=0.61.0
py-spy>=0.3.14
