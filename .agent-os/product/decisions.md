## 2025-09-16: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, LocalLlama Community

### Decision

Create a bridge solution for running Qwen3-Next-80B locally using Intel's AutoRound quantization, targeting the localllama community while waiting for broader tool support.

### Context

The Qwen3-Next-80B model represents a significant advance in open-source LLMs but lacks support in popular local inference tools like llama.cpp. The localllama community needs a working solution that runs on consumer hardware.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Wait for llama.cpp support**
   - Pros: No development effort, established tool
   - Cons: Unknown timeline, community needs solution now

2. **Use standard GPTQ quantization**
   - Pros: More established method
   - Cons: Lower quality than AutoRound, larger memory footprint

3. **Build full-featured inference engine**
   - Pros: Complete solution
   - Cons: Significant effort for temporary solution

### Rationale

Intel's AutoRound provides superior 4-bit quantization quality while reducing the model to ~29GB, making it accessible on consumer GPUs. A focused Python implementation serves immediate community needs while acknowledging the temporary nature of this solution.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Immediate solution for localllama community
- Showcases Intel AutoRound capabilities
- Provides OpenAI-compatible API for easy integration

**Negative:**
- Will become obsolete when llama.cpp adds support
- Limited to Python ecosystem
- Requires ongoing maintenance until deprecation

## 2025-09-16: Free-Threaded Python Build

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Development Team

### Decision

Use Python 3.13.3t free-threaded build for GIL-free performance in multi-threaded inference scenarios.

### Context

The inference server will handle concurrent requests and benefit from true parallelism without Global Interpreter Lock restrictions.

### Rationale

Free-threaded Python enables better CPU utilization during model loading and preprocessing, improving overall throughput for the API server.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Better concurrent request handling
- Improved CPU utilization

**Negative:**
- Some libraries may show GIL warnings
- Requires specific Python build
