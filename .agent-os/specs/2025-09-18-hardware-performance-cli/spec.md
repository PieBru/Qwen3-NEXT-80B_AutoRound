> Spec: Hardware Performance CLI Options
> Created: 2025-09-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Add comprehensive hardware performance measurement CLI options to the Qwen3-80B project to help users understand their system capabilities and predict model inference performance. This feature will provide empirical measurements of CPU, memory, and storage performance that directly correlate with model loading and inference speeds.

## User Stories

### Hardware Assessment for Model Users

As a user with consumer hardware, I want to run performance tests before loading the model, so that I can understand if my system meets the requirements and estimate expected performance.

Users need to quickly assess whether their system can handle the 80B model efficiently. They should be able to run tests that measure RAM bandwidth (critical for model loading), CPU performance (impacts inference speed), and SSD speed (affects model shard loading times). The workflow involves running a simple command like `python qwen3_80b.py --perf-test` which executes all tests and provides a summary report comparing their system to known configurations.

### Performance Debugging

As a developer troubleshooting slow inference, I want to identify hardware bottlenecks, so that I can optimize my system configuration.

When users experience slower than expected performance, they need tools to identify whether the bottleneck is CPU speed, memory bandwidth, or storage I/O. The performance tests should provide detailed metrics that can be compared against expected values for different hardware configurations.

## Spec Scope

1. **Memory Bandwidth Testing** - Measure RAM-to-RAM transfer speeds using various block sizes (small: 1MB, medium: 100MB, large: 1GB+)
2. **CPU Performance Metrics** - Extract and calculate CPU performance indicators including BogoMIPS, single/multi-core benchmarks, and AVX instruction support
3. **Storage I/O Testing** - Measure sequential read speeds for large files matching model shard sizes (~4.5GB chunks)
4. **Hardware Detection** - Comprehensive system information gathering including CPU model, RAM configuration, and storage type
5. **Performance Report Generation** - Generate detailed reports with comparisons to reference systems and performance predictions

## Out of Scope

- GPU compute performance testing (already covered by nvidia-smi)
- Network bandwidth testing (not relevant for local inference)
- Modifying system settings or optimization (read-only testing)
- Windows-specific performance counters (Linux focus)

## Expected Deliverable

1. A `--perf-test` CLI option that runs all performance tests and generates a comprehensive report
2. Individual test options (`--test-memory`, `--test-cpu`, `--test-storage`) for targeted testing
3. JSON output format for automated processing and benchmarking database integration
